# Loan-Risk-Model-C50

## 📌 Project Overview
The 2007-2008 financial crisis highlighted the importance of **accurate risk assessment** in banking.  
This project builds a **machine learning model using C5.0 decision trees** to help banks **identify risky loans**.  

Banks often use automated credit scoring models to decide **loan approvals**.  
Our model aims to **predict loan defaults** based on applicant data, ensuring **fair and transparent lending decisions**.
